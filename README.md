# unit-test
**UNIT**'s Front End DEV **Test**ing

This test consists of a simple CRUD application using material components to perform the proposed tasks, as follow:


* The layout is not the most importante feature but it must be clean and easy to use;
* It is mandatory to use at least the following material components: MatTable with sorting and pagination, MatDialog (for adding and editing record), MatButton and MatSnackbox
* The maintained entity is called 'Category' and must be implemented with the following properties:
>  id: number -> Autoincremented number generated by the application backend. Must be initialized with 0 for new records;
>  title: string -> mandatory title;
>  description: string -> optional description;
>  icon: string -> option icon URL;
>  slug: string -> generated by application's backed might be manually updated;
>  parent: Category = null -> optional id of parent category;
* The integration to the backend must be called using the provided APIService which will add the required header information to the requests.
* New operations (to list, add, update and remove categories) must be implemented on a new Service which will consume APIService
* Backend service specification:

> URL: https://apidev.plataformaunit.com.br/v1/category

> Operations available:
> * GET / list all available categories
> * GET /{id} obtains the category identified by the specified category {id}
> * GET /slug/{slug} obtains the category identified by the specified category {slug}
> * POST / adds or updates a category (**must** receive a Category object as post data)
